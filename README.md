UPS-Transports-GUI
==================

## Import project
The project can simply be opened in Netbeans.

## WSDL
In order for this GUI to work, the WSDL of the UPS Transports service must be available at (and the service must be running) http://localhost:8080/WSTransport/WSTransport.wsdl ; ant will generate sources from that wsdl using wsimport.
